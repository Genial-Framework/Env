-------
Environment configuration file adapter for Genial Framework.

## Installation
```
composer require genial-framework/env
```

We suggest you use composer as it is quicker and easier. You can direct download the package, but if you do that then you need to create an autoloader to load all the files.

## Requirements
- PHP > 7.0

## Contributing
If you are looking to contribute just fork the repo and make changes you wish should be changed. Then post a new pull request and it will be reviewed and if it is all good it will be pushed to the master branch.

## Documentation
> The documentation has not been created yet as Genial Framework is not close to being finished.

## Links
> We will make a website for Genial Framework and it will be public when the first release of the entire framework is finished.
