# Contributing Guidelines
I am glad people like you are looking at the contibuting guidelines becuase we need people to help make Genial Framework the best. This repository is in charge of converting th env configuration values into a custom array that can be accessed through a global `env` function. The only thing we require when contributing is you apply to our coding standard.
## Coding Standard
- Space before and after namespace.
- The comment block header on all files.
  
  https://github.com/Genial-Framework/Env/blob/master/commentBlock
- No empty lines inside global functions including class functions.
- Empty line before and after each function inside classes.
- Put the bracket on a new line when starting a `class`, `function`, `trait`, `interface`, `if`, etc.
- When doing `else`, `elseif`, `catch`, or any of that needs to be on the same line as the statement and the ending bracket needs to be on a new line.

```
if () 
{

} else
{

}
```

```
try
{

} catch ()
{

}
```
- Do not put the php ending tag at the end of the file.
## Consclusion
If you follow the coding standard you should be fine, when post a pull request please explain what the pull request will do and how it will help.

Keep in mind i am looking for dedicated contributors to be a part of a custom team that will manage certain repositories which will give you push and pull request to make the developement of Genial Framework much faster. So if you contribute and help out and want to join the team just email me at nenglish0820@outlook.com and we will see what we can do.
